# Demo Section Not Populated

##

/workspaces/Copilot-Studio-with-Azure-AI-Search/README.md

## Problem

The section labeled "Demo (TBD)" under "## Demo" is incomplete and still contains placeholder text, including an empty numbered list. This provides no actionable guidance for running any demonstration and presents an unfinished appearance to users of the documentation.

## Impact

Medium: Incomplete documentation can confuse readers, reduce their confidence in the instructions elsewhere in the document, and diminish the perceived maturity or readiness of the project.

## Location

Section: "## Demo (TBD)"

## Code Issue

```
(Add steps to start up the demo)

1.
2.
3.
```

## Fix

- Either remove the section entirely if not available.
- Or replace it with a simple, honest placeholder that clearly indicates demo steps are not published yet, for example:

```
*Demo steps will be provided in a future update. Stay tuned!*
```
This makes it clear the absence is intentional and temporary.
